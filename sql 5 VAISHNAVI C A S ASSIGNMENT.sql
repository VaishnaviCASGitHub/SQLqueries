/*1)	Write an SQL query to accomplish the following tasks:*/
/*a)	Create a database named student_db.*/

create database student_db;

/*b)	Create a table named students_details with columns id (integer), 
name (varchar), age (integer), and grade (float). id should be set as the primary key.*/

/*a)	use student_db , */

/*b)	Create a trigger named update_grade that automatically updates the grade column every 
time a record in students_details  is updated based on the following criteria:*/
/*d)	If the updated record has an age value between 18 and 20 (inclusive), multiply the grade by 1.1.*/
/*e)	If the updated record has an age value greater than 20, multiply the grade by 1.05.*/

/*3)	Explain the difference between the AFTER and INSTEAD OF trigger operators in SQL.
â€¢	AFTER TRIGGER- Without the usage of data manipulation keywords like insert, delete, data in the table will be affected.
â€¢	INSTEAD OF TRIGGER- Without the usage of data manipulation keywords like insert, delete, data in the table will not be affected.*/

/*4)	What is the purpose of the INSTEAD OF DELETE trigger operator in SQL?
INSTEAD OF DELETE TRIGGER operator in SQL is used to delete records from the view which we have created.*/
